I decided to challenge myself and go through all suggested resources and paths of Google's TechDevGuide. 
Here I share all my progress with solutions to exercises and problems. 
Specially for this challenge I created a personal blog where you will find detailed analysis, conclusions, thoughts and reviews of what I learned.
So don't hestitate to follow the link above.

If you have any thoughts, ideas or questions, or maybe just want to have talk :) don't hestitate to reach me out. 
I read all messages and will answer as fast as possible.
